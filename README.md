Wallpaper-Changer
=================

Changes wallpapers pseudo-randomly with options for picture navigation.

Requires sqlite3 for python.
Requires idesktop and feh for linux.

This program requires a database of all the wallpapers in the rotation.
The Directory_to_DB.py file can be used to create the database, just edit the file locations in the program.
A blank text file called "command.txt" is also required in the idesktop folder in the home directory.
